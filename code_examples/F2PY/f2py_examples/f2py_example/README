HOW TO USE F2PY

===Basic usage===

This will be illustrated with the porting of the simple flow
line model we developed on Tuesday.

1. Changes to the code:

- remove everything to do with allocation and assign a fixed
  dimension(gird)

- make the program into a subroutine

- add the f2py command strings (start with !f2py)

2. create a signature file (.pyf)

f2py -m simple_ice_model_basic -h simple_ice_model_basic.pyf simple_ice_model_modules_basic.f90 simple_ice_model_basic.f90

3. Edit the signature file

Remove/comment everything with the submodule.  If this is not done,
there will be an ImportError in python.  This might be due to the 
dimension(:) statements, which don't always work in f2py.

4. Make the library

f2py -c --fcompiler=gnu95 simple_ice_model_basic.pyf simple_ice_model_modules_basic.f90 simple_ice_model_basic.f90 

5. import into python and run
>>> import simple_ice_model
>>> simple_ice_model.simple_ice_model()

===Improving a bit===

We want to be able to pass arguments to the subroutine and get the
output returned.

Input: grid, dt, t_final

Output: thick

1. Changes to the code:
 - subroutine simple_ice_model(grid, dt, t_final, thick)
 Note: both the input and output variables need to be passed
 - add f2py command:
!f2py intent(out) thick, xx

2. generate a signature file (.pyf)

f2py -m simple_ice_model -h simple_ice_model.pyf simple_ice_model_modules.f90 simple_ice_model.f90

3. Edit the signature file

Remove/comment everything with the submodule.  If this is not done,
there will be an ImportError in python

4. Make the library
f2py -c --fcompiler=gnu95 simple_ice_model.pyf simple_ice_model_modules.f90 simple_ice_model.f90

5. Run

ipython run_f2py.py

===Advanced===

If we want to run the Fortran module from python, we want to have control over all the model parameters, so we 
include some more function parameters. And as an example of a vector being passed into Fortran, the boundary conditions are changed from two separate floats to a vector of two floats.
