These are educational codes to study python programming for high performance computing.
All codes simulate the 2-dimensional wave propagation with simple FD (Finite-Difference) scheme.
This work is in progress.

Stages for performance acceleration :
Step 1: Using numpy arrays
Step 2: Combining with C function
Step 3: Apply SSE intrinsics (C-level Optimization)
Step 4: Apply OpenMP (C-level Optimization)
Step 5: Extent to MPI
Step 6: Utilize the GPU using PyCUDA
Step 7: Apply CUDA shared memory optimization


Have your fun with Python! (^.^ )/
